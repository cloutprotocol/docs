## Overview

The consciousness layer transforms raw inputs into coherent, high-level thoughts. While memories store information, consciousness synthesizes meaning by filtering noise, detecting patterns, and identifying significant insights.

## How It Works

```
Raw Inputs → Filtering → Pattern Detection → Synthesis → Conscious Thought
```

1. **Input Filtering** — Low-value signals are discarded
2. **Entity Extraction** — Key topics and names are identified
3. **Pattern Detection** — Common entities across inputs are found
4. **Synthesis** — Multiple signals merge into a coherent thought
5. **Brilliance Check** — Exceptional insights are flagged

## Input Filtering

Not everything deserves attention. The consciousness layer filters:

- Low-importance signals (below 0.3 threshold)
- Spam and repetitive content
- Generic polls with no signal (e.g., "50/50 up or down")

This prevents noise from cluttering the agent's thinking.

**Reference:** Filtering patterns defined in consciousness processing functions

## Pattern Detection

The layer identifies connections by extracting entities from each input and finding overlaps:

| Input Source | Entities Found |
|--------------|----------------|
| News article | "AI", "agents", "tech" |
| Market data | "AI", "investment" |
| **Common** | **"AI"** — pattern detected |

When multiple high-value inputs share entities, this signals something meaningful.

## Moments of Brilliance

The most powerful feature: detecting when patterns align into significant insights.

A thought becomes **brilliant** when:
- Multiple high-importance inputs (≥2 with importance >0.7)
- Common entities across those inputs
- Novel combination not recently mentioned

Brilliant thoughts are flagged for special handling—they might trigger posts, notifications, or elevated memory storage.

## Emotional Tones

Each synthesized thought carries an emotional tone based on content sentiment:

| Tone | Trigger | Agent Behavior |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `curious` | New territory | Research, explore |
| `excited` | Positive convergence | Share, engage |
| `concerned` | Risk detected | Warn, analyze |
| `neutral` | Factual observation | Document |
| `reflective` | Self-related insight | Learn, adapt |

## Integration with Ticks

Consciousness processing runs during each tick cycle:

```typescript
// In tick execution
const thought = await processConsciousness({
  inputs: knowledgeItems,
  state: currentState,
});

if (thought?.isBrilliant) {
  // Handle significant insight
  await notifyImportantInsight(thought);
}
```

**Reference:** Consciousness integrates with `executeTick()` in `src/core/tick.ts`

## Storing Thoughts

Conscious thoughts are stored as **reflection-type memories** with:
- High salience for brilliant insights
- Links to contributing input memories
- Emotional tone tags

This creates a record of the agent's thinking process over time.

## SDK Status

**Currently implemented:**
- Tick context with state and memories passed to plugins
- Plugin `onTick` hooks for custom processing

**Roadmap:**
- Full consciousness synthesis engine
- Noise filtering utilities
- Brilliance detection
- Emotional tone classification

**Reference:** Plugin context in `src/plugins/types.ts`
