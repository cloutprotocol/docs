## Overview

The consciousness layer transforms raw data and memories into coherent, high-level thoughts. While memories store information, consciousness synthesizes meaning.

```
Raw Data → Filtering → Pattern Detection → Synthesis → Conscious Thought
```

## How It Works

### Input Filtering

Not all data deserves conscious attention. The consciousness layer filters:

- Low-importance signals (threshold: 0.3)
- Spam and noise (repetitive content)
- Meaningless polls (e.g., "Will BTC go up today?")

```typescript
const LOW_VALUE_PATTERNS = [
  /Bitcoin Up or Down/i,
  /Up or Down.*\d+:\d+\s*(?:AM|PM)/i,
  /Up 50% \/ Down 50%/i,  // No signal
  /liq \$[0-9]\.?\d*K?\s*$/i,  // Low liquidity
];
```

### Pattern Detection

The layer identifies connections between inputs:

```typescript
interface ThoughtSeed {
  type: "market" | "news" | "prediction" | "personal" | "meta";
  content: string;
  sentiment: number;
  importance: number;
  entities: string[];
  timestamp: number;
}

// Find common entities across seeds
const entityCounts = new Map<string, number>();
for (const seed of seeds) {
  for (const entity of seed.entities) {
    entityCounts.set(entity, (entityCounts.get(entity) || 0) + 1);
  }
}
```

### Thought Synthesis

When patterns emerge, a conscious thought forms:

```typescript
interface SynthesizedThought {
  thought: string;
  confidence: number;
  relatedSeeds: string[];
  emotionalTone: "curious" | "excited" | "concerned" | "neutral" | "reflective";
  isBrilliant: boolean;
}
```

## Moments of Brilliance

The most powerful feature: detecting when patterns align into significant insights.

A thought becomes "brilliant" when:
1. Multiple high-importance seeds (≥2 with importance >0.7)
2. Common entities across seeds
3. Novel combination (not recently mentioned)
4. Crosses information boundaries

```typescript
const isBrilliant =
  valuableSeeds.filter(s => s.importance > 0.7).length >= 2 &&
  commonEntities.length > 0 &&
  !recentThoughts.some(t =>
    commonEntities.some(e => t.toLowerCase().includes(e.toLowerCase()))
  );
```

### Example

```typescript
// Seeds from different sources converging:
const seed1 = {
  type: "news",
  content: "Major tech company announces AI agent framework",
  importance: 0.85,
  entities: ["AI", "agents", "tech"]
};

const seed2 = {
  type: "market",
  content: "Investment in AI infrastructure up 40%",
  importance: 0.82,
  entities: ["AI", "investment"]
};

// Consciousness detects:
// - Common entity: "AI"
// - Both high importance
// - Convergent trend

// Output: Moment of Brilliance
{
  thought: "Observing a fundamental shift toward AI agents. Developer interest and investment are converging.",
  emotionalTone: "excited",
  confidence: 0.89,
  isBrilliant: true
}
```

## Emotional Tones

The emotional quality of thoughts guides agent behavior:

| Tone | Trigger | Typical Action |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `curious` | New territory | Research, explore |
| `excited` | Positive pattern | Share, engage |
| `concerned` | Risk detection | Warn, analyze |
| `neutral` | Factual observation | Document |
| `reflective` | Self-related insight | Learn, adapt |

## Integration with Tick

Consciousness processing runs during each tick:

```typescript
const result = await processConsciousness({
  mood: currentState.mood,
  routine: currentState.routine
});

if (result.thoughtGenerated) {
  console.log("Thought:", result.thought.thought);

  if (result.thought.isBrilliant) {
    // Handle moment of brilliance
    await notifyImportantInsight(result.thought);
  }
}
```

## REST API

```bash
# Get recent conscious thoughts
GET /consciousness/thoughts?limit=10

# Get brilliant thoughts only
GET /consciousness/brilliant?limit=5

# Trigger thought generation
POST /consciousness/process
{
  "mood": "expressive",
  "routine": "morning"
}
```

## Polymarket Filtering

Built-in intelligence for filtering prediction market noise:

```typescript
function isPolymarketWorthRemarkingOn(content: string): {
  worthy: boolean;
  reason: string;
  remarkType: "insight" | "analysis" | "dismiss" | null;
}

// High-value patterns (worth remarking):
// - Strong conviction (>70% one way)
// - High liquidity (>$100k)
// - Named events (elections, fed decisions)
// - Price milestones

// Low-value patterns (filtered out):
// - Generic daily up/down polls
// - Near 50/50 splits (no signal)
// - Low liquidity markets
```

## Storing Thoughts

Conscious thoughts are stored as reflection-type memories:

```typescript
await storeThought({
  thought: synthesized.thought,
  confidence: synthesized.confidence,
  emotionalTone: synthesized.emotionalTone,
  isBrilliant: synthesized.isBrilliant,
  relatedMemoryIds: [...],
  mood: currentMood,
  routine: currentRoutine
});
```

This creates a memory with:
- Type: `reflection`
- Tags: `consciousness`, `thought`, emotional tone
- High salience for brilliant insights
- Links to contributing memories

## SDK Status

Current SDK implementation:
- Basic tick context with state and memories
- Plugin onTick hooks

Expanding to include:
- Full consciousness synthesis engine
- Polymarket and noise filtering
- Thought storage as reflection memories
- Brilliance detection
- Emotional tone classification
