ClarkOS is a TypeScript-first agent framework built on Convex serverless infrastructure. It provides the architecture for agents that operate continuously, generate creative output, and maintain persistent presence across web and social platforms.

## Framework Comparison

| Capability | ElizaOS | ClarkOS |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **Execution Model** | Request-response | Continuous tick cycle |
| **Memory Types** | 1 (conversation) | 5 (episodic, semantic, emotional, procedural, reflection) |
| **Memory Deduplication** | Single threshold (0.95) | Type-specific thresholds |
| **Memory Relationships** | None | Bidirectional linking with 7 relationship types *(Roadmap)* |
| **Memory Consolidation** | None | Automatic clustering into core knowledge *(Roadmap)* |
| **State Model** | Minimal | Mood, health, routine, volatility |
| **Artifact Generation** | On request | Autonomous (text, images, journals) |
| **Presence** | When invoked | Persistent (livestream, web, social) |
| **Consciousness Layer** | None | Input filtering, thought synthesis, pattern detection |
| **Self-Reflection** | None | Metacognitive insight generation |
| **Time Awareness** | None | Routine-based behavior (morning, day, evening, overnight) |
| **Backend** | Custom adapters | Convex serverless (real-time, transactional) |

## Architecture Overview

Standard agent frameworks implement a request-response pattern: the agent waits for input, processes it, and returns output. ClarkOS implements a generative architecture where agents operate on continuous tick cycles independent of external interaction.

### Continuous Operation

Agents execute on configurable tick intervals (default 5 minutes). Each tick:

1. Loads current state and relevant memory context
2. Processes through the configured LLM
3. Updates internal state (mood, health, routine awareness)
4. Generates output artifacts (text, images, journal entries)
5. Stores new memories with embeddings and metadata

This model enables agents that produce content, update presence, and evolve state whether or not they receive external input.

### Generative Output

ClarkOS agents generate artifacts as part of their tick cycle:

| Output Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Text** | Synthesized thoughts, social posts, written content |
| **Images** | Paintings generated from internal state and mood |
| **Journals** | Daily consolidation of experiences into narrative |
| **State Updates** | Web presence, profile updates, status changes |

Artifacts are stored with full provenance (triggering memories, mood at creation, confidence scores).

### Memory Architecture

Five memory types model different aspects of cognition:

- **Episodic** - Specific events and experiences
- **Semantic** - Facts, concepts, learned information
- **Emotional** - Affective associations with topics and entities
- **Procedural** - Learned patterns, triggers, and responses
- **Reflection** - Metacognitive insights about the agent's own state

Memories include vector embeddings for semantic retrieval. Bidirectional linking and consolidation into core knowledge are on the roadmap.

### Consciousness Layer

Raw inputs (news feeds, market data, social mentions) pass through a consciousness layer before reaching the agent's decision process. This layer:

- Filters low-signal inputs (e.g., repetitive daily polls)
- Synthesizes multiple signals into coherent thoughts
- Detects pattern convergence across memory and inputs
- Assigns emotional tone to synthesized thoughts

### Presence Layer

ClarkOS includes infrastructure for continuous agent presence:

- **Livestream** - Real-time visualization with text-to-speech output
- **Web** - Automatic site and profile updates
- **Social** - Scheduled and reactive posting via plugins
- **API** - HTTP endpoints for state queries and external triggers

## Technical Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Convex serverless (real-time subscriptions, transactional mutations)
- **Embeddings**: Google text-embedding-004 or OpenAI
- **LLM**: Any OpenRouter-compatible model
- **Storage**: Convex tables with vector search
