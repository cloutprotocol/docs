ClarkOS is a TypeScript-first agent framework built on Convex serverless infrastructure. Agents have persistent memory, autonomous tick execution, and extensible plugin architecture.

## Features

**Memory System**
Five memory types with vector embeddings, automatic deduplication, bidirectional linking, and consolidation into core knowledge.

**Consciousness Layer**
Transforms raw data into coherent thoughts. Detects patterns, filters noise, and generates moments of brilliance.

**Tick System**
The heartbeat of your agent. Each tick loads context, processes through your LLM, updates state, and stores memories.

**Plugin Architecture**
Extend your agent with plugins for social media, trading, analytics, and more. Simple interface with lifecycle hooks.

**Serverless**
Built on Convex. No servers to manage, automatic scaling, real-time subscriptions, transactional guarantees.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloutprotocol/clarkos my-agent
cd my-agent
npm install && npm run dev
```

Your agent is live with persistent memory, real-time state, and HTTP API endpoints.
