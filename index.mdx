## The Next Generation of AI Agents

ClarkOS is a TypeScript-first agent framework that goes beyond simple chatbots. Built on Convex's serverless infrastructure, ClarkOS agents have **persistent memory**, **consciousness synthesis**, and **true autonomy**.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Ship Fast" icon="rocket">
    Three commands to deploy. Zero infrastructure to manage.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Think Deep" icon="brain">
    Multi-layered memory with self-reflection and causal reasoning.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scale Free" icon="arrows-up-down-left-right">
    Serverless by design. From prototype to millions of users.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Three Commands. Real Intelligence.

```bash
npx create-clarkos-agent my-agent
cd my-agent
npm run dev
```

That's it. Your agent is live with persistent memory, real-time state, and autonomous tick execution.

## Why ClarkOS?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="brain" title="Memory That Actually Works">
    ClarkOS implements a cognitive psychology-inspired memory system with **5 distinct memory types**, **type-specific deduplication**, **bidirectional linking**, and **automatic consolidation**. Your agent doesn't just store data—it learns, reflects, and builds knowledge over time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="lightbulb" title="Consciousness Layer">
    Raw data becomes insight. ClarkOS's consciousness layer synthesizes information from multiple sources, filters noise, and generates **moments of brilliance**—high-value observations that emerge from pattern recognition.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="plug" title="Plugin Architecture">
    Extend your agent with plugins for Twitter, Discord, Telegram, trading, and more. Or build your own with our simple plugin interface.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="server" title="Serverless Infrastructure">
    Built on Convex's real-time serverless platform. No servers to manage, automatic scaling, real-time subscriptions, and transactional guarantees.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Better Than ElizaOS

ClarkOS was designed to address the limitations of existing agent frameworks:

| Feature | ClarkOS | ElizaOS |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Memory Deduplication | Type-specific thresholds | Flat 0.95 threshold |
| Memory Types | 5 (including reflection) | 3 |
| Memory Linking | Bidirectional with 7 relationship types | None |
| Self-Reflection | Automatic metacognitive insights | Manual only |
| Consciousness Layer | Higher-order thought synthesis | None |
| Infrastructure | Serverless (Convex) | Self-hosted |
| Real-time Updates | Built-in subscriptions | Polling |
| TypeScript | Strict mode throughout | Partial |
